## Spring Boot 4.1

**Status**: Not yet released. Expected mid-2026 based on historical
release cadence (Spring Boot typically ships minor versions every ~6 months).

**Official release notes**: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.1-Release-Notes
(will be available when released)

### Anticipated Changes

Based on the 4.0 deprecation timeline and Spring team communications:

#### Bridge Removals (Likely)

| Bridge | Status in 4.0 | Expected in 4.1 |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| `spring-boot-jackson2` | Deprecated | Possible removal — prioritize Jackson 3 migration (Track B) |

**Action required**: If you are still using `spring-boot-jackson2`, complete
Track B (Jackson 3 migration) before upgrading to 4.1. Check the official
4.1 release notes when available to confirm.

#### Known Deprecation Promotions

Items deprecated in 4.0 that may see further action in 4.1:
- Deprecated starter names (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`) — still
  expected to work in 4.1, removed in 5.0
- `spring-boot-starter-classic` / `spring-boot-starter-test-classic` —
  still expected to work in 4.1, removed in 5.0

#### New Features to Watch For

Spring Boot minor versions typically introduce:
- New auto-configuration modules
- Additional starter modules
- Updated dependency versions (Spring Framework, Hibernate, etc.)
- New properties and configuration options
- Performance improvements

### Upgrade Checklist for 4.0 → 4.1

## Spring Boot 4.2

**Status**: Not yet released.

**Official release notes**: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.2-Release-Notes
(will be available when released)

### Anticipated Changes

#### Bridge Removals (Likely)

| Bridge | Status | Expected in 4.2 |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| `spring-boot-jackson2` | If not removed in 4.1 | Removal likely |

#### Upgrade Checklist

- [ ] Review 4.2 release notes
