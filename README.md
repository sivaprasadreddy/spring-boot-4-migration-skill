# Spring Boot 4 Migration Skill

A comprehensive [Claude Code skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) for migrating Spring Boot 3.x applications to Spring Boot 4.x and staying current across 4.x minor versions.

## What This Skill Does

When installed, this skill gives Claude Code deep knowledge of every breaking change in Spring Boot 4.x and guides you through migration step-by-step. It supports:

- **Two migration strategies**: All-at-once (9 sequential phases) or gradual upgrade (Day-1 baseline with 6 independent tracks)
- **Compatibility bridges**: `spring-boot-starter-classic`, `spring-boot-jackson2`, `spring-security-access` for incremental adoption
- **Minor version tracking**: Bridge removal timelines, deprecation promotions, and new features for 4.1, 4.2, and beyond
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Build files, modular starters, Jackson 3, properties, package relocations, Spring Security 7, testing (MockitoBean, Testcontainers 2, JUnit 6), Spring Framework 7, Hibernate 7.1, observability (OpenTelemetry, Micrometer, Actuator), API versioning, HTTP interfaces and clients, AOT/native image, JSpecify nullability, resilience (retry, concurrency limiting)
- **Verification script**: Bridge-aware PASS/FAIL/WARN/BRIDGE checks
- **Enterprise rollout**: Wave-based strategy for organizations with many services

## Installation

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude install-skill github:adityamparikh/spring-boot-4-migration-skill
```

### Manual Installation

Copy the contents of this repository to `~/.claude/skills/spring-boot-4-migration/`.

## Usage

In Claude Code, say any of:

- "Migrate this project to Spring Boot 4"
- "Upgrade to Spring Boot 4"
- "Spring Boot 4 migration"
- "Gradual upgrade to Boot 4"
- "Upgrade to Spring Boot 4.1"
- "Update Boot minor version"

The skill will activate automatically and guide you through the migration.
